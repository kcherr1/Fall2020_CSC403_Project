### Thien
#### 1.Added ability for the player to die. Player dies when reaching or going below 0 hp. Upon death, player icon dissapears and they are prompted to restart. If they decline, the application closes.
#### 2.Added ability for the player to save and load. Saving can be done by pressing F5. Loading can be done by bringing up the save menu, pressing one of the save buttons, and then pressing the load game button. Loading can also be done in the game by pressing F9.
###### List of saved items:
- Player health, skills, and skillpoints
- Player position
- Enemy health
- Enemy death flag
#### 3.Added ability to flee from enemy. If fleeing fails, player takes damage. If fleeing succeeds, the enemy's hp gets reset the battle screen closes.
##### What went right: Save system was simple easier to implement.
##### What went wrong: Save system was and will be tedious to integrate with new systems. Its simplicity makes its inflexible. All things must be saved manually.
