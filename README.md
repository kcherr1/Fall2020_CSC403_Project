Mode Selection:

While starting the game, the player is asked to select the game mode (Classic, Ghost). The classic mode is the regular game. Ghost mode is where the enemies are invisible and the player attacks the enemy as they pass.






Health Potions:

The player collects the health potions while playing the game. The player collects them as they pass through. This will increase the overall health of the player. The collected health potions are displayed in the boxes above the exit button.

The character is disappeared after the player loses the battle. This happens when the health reaches to 0.

Post the attack with the enemy, if the hero loses the battle, a LoseScreen is displayed where you have the options to exit the game or to go back to the main menu.
If the hero wins all the battles, then a WinScreen is displayed with the options to exit the game or to go back to the main menu.
