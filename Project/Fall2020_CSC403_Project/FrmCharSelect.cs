project: CSC 403 Sprint #1
desc: Windows form to present user with a choice between four different characters: Mr Peanut, Martin the Gecko (From geico), Toucan Sam, and the Pillsbury Doughboy.

note:
Each button to select a character has its own function. The function begins a new instance of the FrmLevel class, shows it, and then sets the character 
image to the correct character based on which button was pressed.
